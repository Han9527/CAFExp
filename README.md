1) Making two root dist files in R:

write.table(table(rpois(10000, 10)), file='examples/poisson_root_dist_10000.txt', quote=FALSE, sep='\t', col.names=FALSE, row.names=FALSE)
write.table(cbind(1:25, 400), file='examples/unif_root_dist_10000.txt', row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE, sep='\t', quote=FALSE)

1) Simulating gene families without discrete gamma categories to check lk surface:
    1.1) Poisson (poisson lambda=10) root distribution:
    ``$ python scripts/cfg_maker.py -c bin/ -ia t,f -iv examples/mammals_tree.txt,examples/poisson_root_dist_10000.txt -oa s,n -ov ,10000 -pa l -pv 0.001 -oua s -ouv p10_sim0.001``  
    ``$ mv config_file_0.cfg p10_0.001_sim_config_file.cfg``

    ``$ python scripts/cfg_maker.py -c bin/ -ia t,f -iv examples/mammals_tree.txt,examples/poisson_root_dist_10000.txt -oa s,n -ov ,10000 -pa l -pv 0.005 -oua s -ouv p10_sim0.005``  
    ``$ mv config_file_0.cfg p10_0.005_sim_config_file.cfg``

    ``$ python scripts/cfg_maker.py -c bin/ -ia t,f -iv examples/mammals_tree.txt,examples/poisson_root_dist_10000.txt -oa s,n -ov ,10000 -pa l -pv 0.01 -oua s -ouv p10_sim0.01``  
    ``$ mv config_file_0.cfg p10_0.01_sim_config_file.cfg``  

    1.2) Uniform root distribution:
    ``$ python scripts/cfg_maker.py -c bin/ -ia t,f -iv examples/mammals_tree.txt,examples/unif_root_dist_10000.txt -oa s,n -ov ,10000 -pa l -pv 0.001 -oua s -ouv unif_sim0.001``  
    ``$ mv config_file_0.cfg unif_0.001_sim_config_file.cfg``

    ``$ python scripts/cfg_maker.py -c bin/ -ia t,f -iv examples/mammals_tree.txt,examples/unif_root_dist_10000.txt -oa s,n -ov ,10000 -pa l -pv 0.005 -oua s -ouv unif_sim0.005``  
    ``$ mv config_file_0.cfg unif_0.005_sim_config_file.cfg``

    ``$ python scripts/cfg_maker.py -c bin/ -ia t,f -iv examples/mammals_tree.txt,examples/unif_root_dist_10000.txt -oa s,n -ov ,10000 -pa l -pv 0.01 -oua s -ouv unif_sim0.01``  
    ``$ mv config_file_0.cfg unif_0.01_sim_config_file.cfg``
